# javascript-30

Taking the 30 day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge. In addition, for each project in the 30 day challenge, I tried to modify and extend the project in some way to make it unique. Please check out my projects!

I hope to integrate this experience into my personal website and future web development that I do. Also, I'd like to make apps using JS in the future. Due to the usefulness and fun of JS, I took this challenge.
